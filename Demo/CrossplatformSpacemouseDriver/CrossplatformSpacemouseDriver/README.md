# CrossplatformSpacemouseDriver
This repository contains a universal 3D connexxion spacemouse driver for Linux, Windows and macOS.


# Working Platforms
The example works under Windows 10 Enterprise 64/32bit, Ubuntu 16.10 64/32bit, Mac OS sierra. (still have to compile hidapi for mac);


I even think it's possible to enable android support with USB-otg. But not sure about that.
